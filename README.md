Hello! I’m @sladeedmonds.
A permanent/forever student of technology and a 20+ year veteran of the industry, I love learning, absolutely love the cloud and I love Microsoft :)

In many ways, discovering the cloud has had an even bigger impact on me than discovering the Internet (back in the 90's)!  My desire to be a part of this movement is intense. I am absolutely blown away by the talent, creativity, and giving nature of those around the globe.  I can't keep up, not even close.  And I love it!

Lately, I've been doing a lot with Docker.  My next goal is to learn Kubernetes.
